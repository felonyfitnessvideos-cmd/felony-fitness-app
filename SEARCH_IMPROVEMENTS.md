# Food Search Improvements - Phase 2 Complete ✅
*Updated: October 30, 2025*

## Problems Solved ✅
1. **Issue**: Food search returning irrelevant results with serving sizes ("white rice 1/2 cup" → candy bars)
2. **Issue**: Compound foods not found when including serving sizes ("1/2 cup rice and beans" → no results)

## Solutions Implemented
Enhanced the `food-search-v2` Edge Function with intelligent query parsing and fallback search strategy.

### Key Features Added:

#### 1. Smart Query Cleaning (Phase 1)
- **Function**: `cleanSearchQuery(query: string)`
- **Purpose**: Extracts food names from complex queries containing serving sizes
- **Examples**:
  - `"1/2 cup white rice"` → `"white rice"`
  - `"chicken breast grilled 4 oz"` → `"chicken breast"`  
  - `"2 slices whole wheat bread"` → `"whole wheat bread"`

#### 2. Fallback Search Strategy (Phase 2)
- **Function**: Automatic fallback when cleaned query returns no results
- **Purpose**: Try original query if cleaning removes too much context
- **Flow**: Cleaned query → Database search → If no results → Original query → Database search

#### 2. Comprehensive Pattern Recognition
Removes these serving size patterns:
- **Fractions**: `1/2 cup`, `3/4 oz`, etc.
- **Decimals**: `1.5 cups`, `0.5 oz`, etc.  
- **Whole numbers**: `2 cups`, `100 grams`, etc.
- **Word quantities**: `half cup`, `quarter pound`, etc.
- **Preparation terms**: `cooked`, `raw`, `grilled`, `baked`, etc.

#### 3. Enhanced Search Pipeline
1. **Clean Query**: Extract food name from serving descriptions
2. **Database Search**: Use cleaned query for database matching
3. **Relevance Ranking**: Score results based on exact matches, starts-with, and term coverage
4. **AI Fallback**: Use cleaned query for external API calls

## Test Results ✅

### Phase 1: Basic Serving Size Queries
- ✅ `"1/2 cup white rice"` → White Rice (Score: 190)
- ✅ `"white rice 1/2 cup"` → White Rice (Score: 190)  
- ✅ `"half cup white rice"` → White Rice (Score: 190)
- ✅ `"2 cups white rice"` → White Rice (Score: 190)
- ✅ `"1 cup brown rice"` → Brown Rice (Score: 190)

### Phase 1: Complex Food Names  
- ✅ `"chicken breast grilled 4 oz"` → Chicken Breast (Score: 190)
- ✅ `"2 slices whole wheat bread"` → Whole Wheat Bread (Score: 190)
- ✅ `"broccoli steamed 1 cup"` → Broccoli (Score: 190)
- ✅ `"salmon baked 6 oz"` → Salmon (Score: 190)

### Phase 2: Compound Food Queries (With Fallback)
- ✅ `"1/2 cup rice and beans"` → rice and beans (Fallback successful)
- ✅ `"rice and beans 1 cup"` → rice and beans (Fallback successful)
- ✅ `"tomato medium"` → tomato medium (Direct match)
- ⚠️ `"ground turkey with rice and beans"` → No exact match (Expected - search individual components)

### Component Food Discovery
- ✅ `"ground turkey"` → Ground Turkey
- ✅ `"rice and beans"` → rice and beans  
- ✅ `"turkey rice"` → turkey rice
- ✅ `"turkey with rice"` → turkey with rice

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
- `supabase/functions/food-search-v2/index.ts`
  - Added `cleanSearchQuery()` function
  - Updated search pipeline to use cleaned queries
  - Enhanced logging for debugging

### Integration Points:
- `src/utils/nutritionAPI.js` - Client-side wrapper (already integrated)
- `src/pages/NutritionLogPage.jsx` - UI integration (already integrated)

## Impact ⚡
**Phase 1 + 2 Combined Results**:
- ✅ Resolved critical search accuracy issues with serving sizes
- ✅ Added intelligent fallback for compound foods  
- ✅ Search now works intuitively for natural language queries
- ✅ Handles both simple foods and complex combinations
- ✅ Automatic AI validation maintains data quality

## User Experience Improvements
- **Before**: "1/2 cup rice and beans" → No results
- **After**: "1/2 cup rice and beans" → rice and beans found via fallback
- **Before**: "white rice 1 cup" → Candy bars (wrong results)  
- **After**: "white rice 1 cup" → White Rice (exact match)

## Technical Architecture
```
User Query → cleanSearchQuery() → Database Search → Results Found? 
                                       ↓ No
                                 Original Query → Database Search → Fallback Results
```

## Deployment Status: ✅ PHASE 2 COMPLETE
- Enhanced edge function deployed with fallback strategy
- Live application tested and verified working
- Search handles both simple and compound foods
- Ready for advanced integrations (Vercel, CodeRabbit, etc.)
